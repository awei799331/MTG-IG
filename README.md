## What does this project aspire to do?

For Magic the Gathering players everywhere, there's a common problem that they all endure: the constant fluctuations of the market, and the risk of your precious cards dropping in value. In response, we've set out to create a website that allows a user to easily see the predicted price of their precious cards. This price prediction is done using machine learning, incorporating data about the card, like their mana cost and in game stats, as well as historical prices in a three tiered model. The website will incorporate a search engine that harnesses the power of the leading MTG search engine: Scryfall. Users will be able to see their cards, basic information about them, as well as the projected prices in an user friendly interface. In essence, this website will serve as a portal of pricing information for all users, whether they are serious investors, or casual players making sure their cards are a good buy.
